# INF552 - Data Visualization

## Individual project

This will evaluate the theoretical knowledge and visualization design skills that you will have acquired during the course. The projects start now, with the following milestones:

-   M1: by session 03, identify a dataset (or collection thereof) that you are interested in visualizing (base on your own interests), and validate it with me (just a sanity check to confirm feasibility); you can use the catalogs and search engines referenced on slide 7 of the course slide deck (INF552-2021-course-s01) to search for data, or use any other means;
-   M2: between sessions 05 & 07, a brief discussion (either async' on Slack or during a PC session) to keep me posted about progress and where you're heading;
-   M3: submit a short report by mid-December. An assignment will be created for this, with a hard deadline.

This is really about the design of a visualization. You may write code to create it (D3, Vega-Lite, ggplot2, anything else), or use dedicated software such as Tableau, or even draw it on paper. There are no restrictions about how you create the visualizations for this project.
